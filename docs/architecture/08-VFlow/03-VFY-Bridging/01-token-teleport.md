title: Teleport Token across zkVerify Parachains
---

## XCM Teleport

A **teleport** is a powerful Cross-Consensus Message (XCM) instruction that facilitates the movement of assets between zkVerify Relay Chain and its System Parachains.

A teleport of an asset (VFY token) is an operation performed in two stages by an XCM executor: one part is executed on the Relay chain (burns the asset) and the other part on the Parachain (minting of the asset).

In this guide, we will be using teleport to move VFY tokens from zkVerify to VFlow and viceversa.

You can find more information on XCM [here](https://polkadot.com/blog/xcm-the-cross-consensus-message-format/).

### From zkVerify to VFlow via PolkadotJS-UI

From [PolkadotJS](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fzkverify-volta-rpc.zkverify.io#/explorer) navigate to `Developer-> Extrinsics` and select the `xcmPallet` pallet and the `teleportAssets` extrinsic:

![alt_text](./img/extrinsic_relay.png)

You can see that we need to supply 4 parameters: `dest`, `beneficiary`, `assets` and `feeAssetItem`.
You can either use the `Quick Teleport Guide` or follow starting from the `Destination` section.

#### Quick Teleport Guide

Go to `Developer -> Extrinsics -> Decode` and copy/paste the following hex:

`0x8c0105000100040500010300000000000000000000000000000000000000000005040000000000000000`

Then from `Decode` move to `Submission`

You need to change the following parameters:

- `beneficiary -> V5 -> X1 -> AccountKey20 -> key: [u8, 20]`: with the EVM address of the receiver on VFlow
- `assets -> V5 -> 0 -> id -> fun -> Fungible: Compact<u128>`: with the amount of VFY tokens you want to teleport to VFlow (specified with 18 digits)

Click on `submitTransaction` and then `sign And Submit` on the new window that will appear to conclude the teleport.

#### Destination

![alt_text](./img/dest_relay.png)

This parameter specifies the target chain where the assets are being teleported. Let's select:

- For `dest: XcmVersionedLocation` select `V5` from the scroll-down menu. New fields will pop-up. Let's set:
    - For `parents` input `0`
    - For `interior` select `X1` from the scroll-down menu. Then new fields will appear. Let's set:
        -For `0` select `Parachain` from the scroll-down menu
        - We need finally to insert the ID of the VFlow `Parachain`, which is `1`.

#### Beneficiary

![alt_text](./img/beneficiary_relay.png)

This specifies the account that will receive the assets on the destination chain. Let's set:

- For `beneficiary: XcmVersionedMultiLocation` select `V5` from the scroll-down menu. New fields will pop-up. Let's set:
    - For `parents` input `0`
    - For `interior` input `X1` from the scroll-down menu. Then new fields will appear. Let's set:
        - For `0` select `AccountKey20` from the scroll-down menu
        - For `key` input the address of the Ethereum account you want to receive the assets on VFlow. 

#### Assets

![alt_text](./img/assets_relay.png)

This defines the actual asset(s) and the amount(s) you are sending. Let's set:

- For `assets: XcmVersionedMultiAsset` select `v5` from the scroll-down menu. Click on the `Add Item` button. New fields will pop-up. Let's set:
    - For `parents` input `0`
    - For `interior` select  `Here` from the scroll-down menu. Then new fields will appear. Let's set:
        - For `fun` select `Fungible` from the scroll-down menu
        - For `Fungible` input the amount of assets you want to send. e.g. to send 1 VFY , remembering that the token has 18 decimals, it's: `1000000000000000000`.

#### Fee Asset Item

This is simply the index of the asset in the `assets` array that will be used to pay for the XCM teleport fee. We only have a single asset (VFY) and we are using that one, so we set it to `0`.

#### Submitting the Extrinsic

Click on `submitTransaction` and then `sign And Submit` on the new window that will appear to conclude the teleport.

### From VFlow to zkVerify via PolkadotJS-UI

The process here is exactly a mirror of what we did on zkVerify side.
From [PolkadotJS](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fvflow-volta-rpc.zkverify.io#/explorer) navigate to `Developer-> Extrinsics` and select the `zkvXcm` pallet and the `teleportAssets` extrinsic.

![alt_text](./img/extrinsic_para.png)

Like before we need to supply 4 parameters: `dest`, `beneficiary`, `assets` and `feeAssetItem`.
You can either use the `Quick Teleport Guide` or follow starting from the `Destination` section.


#### Quick Teleport Guide

Go to `Developer -> Extrinsics -> Decode` and copy/paste the following hex:

`0x6449595d731d231ccc6624a532469697b10dfea29e2843cc171ba7bdcde1c4cd`

You need to change the following parameters:

- `beneficiary -> V5 -> X1 -> AccountId32 -> id: [u8, 32]`: with the address of the receiver on zkVerify
- `assets -> V5 -> 0 -> id -> fun -> Fungible: Compact<u128>`: with the amount of VFY tokens you want to teleport to zkVerify (specified with 18 digits)

Click on `submitTransaction` and then `sign And Submit` on the new window that will appear to conclude the teleport. 

#### Destination

Let's start with the `dest` parameter:

![alt_text](./img/dest_para.png)

- For `dest: XcmVersionedLocation` select `V5` from the scroll-down menu. New fields will pop-up. Let's set:
    - For `parents` input `1`
    - For `interior` select `Here` from the scroll-down menu. Then new fields will appear. Let's set:

#### Beneficiary

Let's set the `beneficiary` parameter as follows:

![alt_text](./img/beneficiary_para.png)

- For `beneficiary: XcmVersionedMultiLocation` select `V5` from the scroll-down menu. New fields will pop-up. Let's set:
    - For `parents` input `0`
    - For `interior` select `X1` from the scroll-down menu. Then new fields will appear. Let's set:
        - For `0` select `AccountId32` from the scroll-down menu
        - For `id` input the address of the zkVerify account you want to receive the assets on zkVerify.

#### Assets

Let's set the `assets` parameter as follows:

![alt_text](./img/assets_para.png)

- For `assets: XcmVersionedMultiAsset` select `V5` from the scroll-down menu. Click on the `Add Item` button. New fields will pop-up. Let's set:
    - For `parents` input `1`
    - For `interior` select `Here` from the scroll-down menu. Then new fields will appear. Let's set:
        - For `fun` select `Fungible` from the scroll-down menu
        - For `fun` input the amount of assets you want to send. e.g. to send 1 VFY , remembering that the token has 18 decimals, it's: `1000000000000000000`.

#### Fee Asset Item

This is simply the index of the asset in the `assets` array that will be used to pay for the XCM teleport fee. We only have a single asset (VFY) and we are using that one, so we set it to `0`.

#### Submitting the extrinsic

Click on `submitTransaction` and then `sign And Submit` on the new window that will appear to conclude our teleport.

### From VFlow to zkVerify via EVM Tooling

We've included a precompile contract in VFlow that allows you to teleport VFY tokens to zkVerify directly from your standard EVM tools (like Metamask).
Contract is deployed at address `2060`. Here is an example script leveraging `web3` library:

```javascript
const { Web3 } = require('web3');

// Configuration
const RPC_URL = 'wss://vflow-volta-rpc.zkverify.io'; // VFlow RPC endpoint
const PRIVATE_KEY = ''; // Your Ethereum account private key
const PRECOMPILE_ADDRESS = '0x000000000000000000000000000000000000080C'; // XCM Teleport precompile address

// XCM Teleport precompile ABI
const teleportABI = [
  {
    name: 'teleportToRelayChain',
    type: 'function',
    inputs: [
      { name: 'destinationAccount', type: 'bytes32' },
      { name: 'amount', type: 'uint256' },
    ],
    outputs: [],
    stateMutability: 'nonpayable',
  },
];

async function testTeleport() {
  // Initialize Web3
  const web3 = new Web3(RPC_URL);

  // Add your account to the wallet
  const account = web3.eth.accounts.privateKeyToAccount(PRIVATE_KEY);
  web3.eth.accounts.wallet.add(account);

  console.log(`Using account: ${account.address}`);

  // Check balance
  const balance = await web3.eth.getBalance(account.address);
  console.log(`Account balance: ${web3.utils.fromWei(balance, 'ether')} tVFY`);

  // Set up the contract
  const contract = new web3.eth.Contract(teleportABI, PRECOMPILE_ADDRESS);

  // Test parameters
  const destinationAccount = ''; // 32-byte relay chain account
  const amount = web3.utils.toWei('1', 'ether'); // 1 VFY

  console.log(`Teleporting ${web3.utils.fromWei(amount, 'ether')} VFY`);
  console.log(`From: ${account.address} (parachain)`);
  console.log(`To: ${destinationAccount} (relay chain)`);

  // Estimate gas
  const gasEstimate = await contract.methods
    .teleportToRelayChain(destinationAccount, amount)
    .estimateGas({ from: account.address });

  console.log(`Estimated gas: ${gasEstimate}`);

  // Send transaction
  console.log('Sending transaction...');
  const result = await contract.methods
    .teleportToRelayChain(destinationAccount, amount)
    .send({
      from: account.address,
      gas: gasEstimate,
    });

  console.log('âœ… Transaction successful!');
  console.log(`Transaction hash: ${result.transactionHash}`);
  console.log(`Block number: ${result.blockNumber}`);
  console.log(`Gas used: ${result.gasUsed}`);
}

testTeleport();

```

A couple of important notes:
- In this case, the `amount` to be sent, doesn't require to specify 18 decimals.
- The `destinationAccount` is an hex public key of zkVerify. While from PolkadotJS-UI you can use the AccountID and PolkadotJS automatically performs the conversion to the correct format, in this case you need to do it manually.
From [PolkadotJS](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fzkverify-volta-rpc.zkverify.io#/explorer) navigate to `Developer-> Utilities` and select the `Convert Address` tab:

![alt_text](./img/convert_address.png)

Just copy paste the account id in the `address to convert` field to automatically get the public key to use as `destinationAccount`.

### Teleport via zkv-xcm-library
We've developed a Typescript library, called [zkv-xcm-library](https://github.com/zkVerify/zkv-xcm-library?tab=readme-ov-file#zkverify-xcm-library), in order to simplify the creation of such XCM teleport extrinsics and for ease of integration with your app/frontend.
Check the readme for installation and usage instructions.

### A Note on XCM Teleport Fees

Since an XCM message is executed both on the Relay Chain and Parachain side, both sender and receiver need to pay for execution fees. However:
- The fees charged to the sender **are deducted directly from its main balance**. This happens immediately when the transaction is included in a block, **before the teleport's burn logic is even executed**. So, if after fee deduction your remaining balance is not enough to cover the burn logic, the transaction will fail.
- The fees charged to the receiver **are deducted from the amount being teleported**. This happens when the XCM message is executed on the Parachain side.

### Deep-Dive: XCM Parameters Explanation

Let's provide a brief explanation here of the complex XCM message construction and parameters we've seen before:
- `dest` provides details about the destination of the message (we need to select the XCM version currently being used. V5 is the most-up-to-date at the time of writing).
    - `parents` tells the XCM executor that the following `interior` is relative to the chain itself. 

    - `interior` describes the rest of the path, the specific, step-by-step directions to the final destination. It defines a sequence of "hops" or _Junctions_. Each junction is a specific location or entity within a consensus system.
        - The interior is structured as a container, usually X1, X2, X3, etc. where X stands for the number of Junctions (hops) in the path.
            - Here: Equivalent to X0, no junctions.
            - X1: A path with one junction.
            - X2: A path with two junctions.
            - ...and so on, up to X8.

You could think of it like a File System where: 
- The root directory is the Relay Chain
- There are as many sub-directories as Parachains.
- In each directory there is a list of consensus entities (accounts, pallets, etc.) living in that Relay Chain/Parachain.

![alt_text](./img/fs_metaphor.png)

So setting `parents = 0` means it's the current location (in bash it would be `.`) while `parents = 1` means it's the parent location (in bash it would be `..`).

Setting `interior = X1 { Parachain: 3 }` means essentially specifying `./parachain_3`;
Instead setting `interior = X2 { Parachain: 3, AccountKey20: 0x111 }` means essentially specifying `./parachain_3/account_111`

Putting it all together, in this case, we are initiating the teleport from the Relay Chain (so `parents` is 0, since we are already on the Relay Chain) to the Parachain with id `1`, which is *one hop* away from the parent (so `interior` is `X1` with `Parachain` set to `1`).
