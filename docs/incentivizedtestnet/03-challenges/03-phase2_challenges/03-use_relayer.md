title: Use the zkVerify Relayer
---

### Overview
The zkVerify Relayer is a tool that makes it easy to verify zero-knowledge proofs using the zkVerify network. This challenge invites you to explore its functionality, submit real proofs, and provide valuable feedback to improve the developer experience.

This is a technical challenge within the zkVerify Incentivized Testnet Phase 2. By completing the tasks below, you can earn zkVerify Incentivized Testnet Points and move up the leaderboard.

**Start here**: Read the [Relayer documentation](../../../overview/02-getting-started/05-relayer.md) to understand how the system works.

### Tasks & Rewards

#### Submit Proofs Using the Relayer API

Submit one or more zero-knowledge proofs using the Relayer. You will earn 20 zkVerify Incentivized Testnet Points per proof type (once per type):

| Proof Type | Points |
|---|---|
| Groth16 | 20 |
| UltraPlonk | 20 |
| Risc0 | 20 |
| Plonky2 | 20 |
| Proof of SQL | 20 |
| Fflonk | 20 |

Each proof must be submitted via the Relayer API. You’ll need to submit proof of submission using the form linked below.

:::note
To use the Relayer API, you will need an API key. Contact a zkVerify team member or open a ticket on Discord to request a unique key. You may also use this API key, but will need to show proof of the number of proofs submitted (jobID or txn hash): 598f259f5f5d7476622ae52677395932fa98901f

This API key is publicly available for testing purposes. If you plan to submit multiple proofs and earn Points accordingly, you’ll need to request a unique API key as described above or send each job ID/ txn hash submitted using the public API key.

#### Submit Proofs at Scale

Relayer usage is tracked via your API key. Earn additional zkVerify Incentivized Testnet Points based on your submission volume over time:

| Number of Proofs Submitted | Points |
|---|---|
| 100 | 50 |
| 250 | 100 |
| 500 | 200 |
| 1000+ | 500 |

#### Provide Feedback on the Relayer

Help improve the tool by submitting detailed feedback or reporting issues:

- Complete the [Relayer Feedback Form](https://forms.gle/PVjhLkDt2TbgmspGA): 50 points

- Report an unknown bug (include sufficient details and screenshots): +50 points

### How to Claim Points

Once you’ve submitted a proof or provided feedback:
1. Fill out the [submission form](https://forms.gle/PVjhLkDt2TbgmspGA)
2. Provide your EVM wallet address and the Job ID or transaction hash for the proof you submitted via the Relayer
3. The zkVerify team will verify your submission and assign points accordingly


Make sure to use the provided API key or your unique API key for all submissions so that your activity can be accurately tracked.
