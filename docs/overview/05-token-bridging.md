title: Token Bridging
---

## Native token tVFY bridging

Token bridging is a component offered by **Hyperbridge**. \
Currently native token tVFY can be teleported to **Ethereum Sepolia** and back as well. \
In the future more networks will be supported.

### From zkVerify to Sepolia ETH

From [PolkadotJS](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fvolta-rpc.zkverify.io#/explorer) navigate to `Developer-> Extrinsics` and select the `tokenGateway` pallet and the `teleport` extrinsic.

This call is used to initialize a cross-chain asset transfer. Any provided assets are custodied by the pallet and a cross-chain request is dispatched to the destination supported chain.


#### Parameters Definitions

- `assetId`: the local asset Id registered on Hyperbridge and that should be transferred.
- `destination`: Destination state machine that should receive the funds, defined by its chain type and chain id. 
- `recipient`: The beneficiary account for the funds on the destination.
- `amount`: The amount that should be transferred.
- `timeout`:The request timeout, this is the time after which the request cannot be delivered to the destination. It should represent the cumulative time for finalization on the source chain and Hyperbridge with some additional buffer. 
- `tokengateway`: The address of the token gateway module on the destination chain. 
- `relayer_fee`: The amount to be paid to relayers for delivering the request, a value of zero means the dispatcher is responsible for relaying the request. For now it's okay to leave it to 0.
- `redeem`: Boolean specifying if we are redeeming an existing ERC20.

#### Parameters Template hex-encoded call

Instead of copying each value at a time from the previous you can decode a complete extrinsic example and only change the values you need.
For this purpose, go to `Developer -> Extrinsics -> Decode` and copy/paste the following hex

***0x5d000000000000a736aa000000000000000000000000006a88ce5345fdf2afef1d5dd26104696e9c3a3e8800008a5d784563010000000000000000000000000000000050fcda26ca021d5535c3059547390e6ccd8de7aca6000000000000000000000000000000000000***

Then click on the `Submission` tab and change the values you need. 
### From Sepolia ETH to zkVerify

First find the TokenGateway contract deployed on the EVM of interest (in this case zkVerify)

The contract addresses can be found here

https://docs.hyperbridge.network/developers/evm/contracts/mainnet
https://docs.hyperbridge.network/developers/evm/contracts/testnet

So this is the Tokegateway sepolia ETH contract

https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xFcDa26cA021d5535C3059547390E6cCd8De7acA6#writeContract

The method of interest is `teleport`

![alt_text](./img/teleport-back.png)

- `amount`: amount to be sent, in wei or whatever the decimals used for the source token. For example, for tVFY, 18 decimals.
- `relayerFee`: The amount to be paid to relayers for delivering the request
- `assetId`: this is the bytes32 representation of the token symbol of the token you want to send. In this case, the symbol is tVFY and the assetID is the result of the following operation in solidity
  ![alt_text](./img/symbol.png)

Which in this case is 0xbce67a4632d733ff3d4599502fc9c8812688ce39220e4304bd7b43c22ae5c77c

- `redeem`: Always false, we will not deploy ERC20 on our own.
- `to` ->  This is the destination address receiving the tokens. It has to be given in public key hex format. You can use the subkey command line tool to get your zkverify address in the right format
  ![alt_text](./img/subkey.png)

  ![alt_text](./img/subkey-result.png)

- `dest`: This is the bytes representation of the destination chain, in this case zkverify. In practice, itâ€™s the result of the following operation in solidity
  ![alt_text](./img/destination.png)

- `timeout`: The request timeout, this is the time after which the request cannot be delivered to the destination. It should represent the cumulative time for finalization on the source chain and hyperbridge with some additional buffer. If 0, it means it never times out.
- `nativeCost`: Amount of native token to pay for dispatching the request. if 0 will use the `IIsmpHost.feeToken`
- `data`: destination contract call data

When the tx succeeds, the transaction from EVM side looks like following https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0x3112a43a76019ae77fee56d7721a3fface395ae70d014affe3d17792d16ed3f1

And then from zkverify side, these are the extrinsics and events
